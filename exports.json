It’s true, I have been thinking about moving that site to make it static, almost certainly using <em>Hugo</em>, but I thought before doing so I’d give <em>Drupal 8</em> one more try.  I’m pleased to report that it’s working nicely again.  Here’s how I did it, and how I plan to keep it updated…</p><h2 id='saved-by-docker-compose-drupal'>Saved by “docker-compose-drupal”</h2><p>I actually started the process of migrating and updating <a href='https://wieting.tamatoledo.com'>the Wieting website</a> in <em>Docksal</em>, but I failed… I could never figure out how to reliably and easily push my work to production from there.  <em>Docksal</em> just seems to wrap so much of itself into the <code>cli</code> container that drives it, I found it difficult to de-couple from that in production.</p><p>So I went looking elsewhere and discovered <a href='https://devwithlando.org'>Lando</a>, and I did considerable work with it because <em>Lando</em>, at least in the case of <em>Drupal</em>, builds a 3-part development stack that looks a lot like what I wanted to deploy in production.  The parts of a <em>Lando</em> stack, and my production stack, are the same:</p><ul><li>An <code>nginx</code> web server container,</li><li>A <code>mysql</code> or <code>mariadb</code> database container, and</li><li>A <code>php</code> codebase container.</li></ul><p>But once again I had trouble figuring out exactly how to push that development stack to production.  So, I went looking again for an open (and by that I mean “free” and freely modifiable) production-ready stack configuration that uses the 3-parts I had in mind.  I found <a href='https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal'>docker-compose-drupal</a> and almost immediately created <a href='https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal'>my own fork</a> of that project. Using <a href='https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal'>my <code>docker-compose-drupal</code> fork</a> I set off to build a production instance, NOT a development instance, on my <code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker</code> droplet at <em>DigitalOcean</em>.  That project came to life in <code>/opt/docker-compose-drupal</code> there.</p><p>The evolution of <code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker:/opt/docker-compose-drupal</code> was quite an adventure, in large part because the <em>Wieting’s</em> web site had gone almost a year without any updates.  That meant upgrading the <em>Drupal</em> core from version 8.2.? to version 8.8.2, along with countless modules that had changed rather dramatically, so there were lots of bumps along the way.  I also had to move the site from a multi-site configuration, the old site lived in a container at <code>/var/www/html/web/sites/wieting</code>, to a <em>default</em> configuration that lives in the container at <code>/var/www/localhost/web/sites/default</code>.</p><p>Fortunately, <a href='https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal'>docker-compose-drupal</a> includes some nice scripts and features to help with things like that, and they are nicely documented in the <a href='https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal/blob/master/README.md'>project’s README.md</a> file.  I’ll elaborate on a few of the key features later in this post, but most of what I did during the migration and update is water-under-the-bridge, and should not need to be repeated, ever, so I won’t elaborate on all of it here.

We generally walk in the morning before the heat, humidity, and mosquitoes get too bad.  We finally got power back on Thursday evening, August 20, so on Friday morning, August 21, 2020, we walked for the first time since the derecho of August 10. It was actually more like an obstacle course than our usual stroll, but we still managed to collect quite a bit of trash, as usual. There were about a dozen places around the lake, a trail that is about 1.33 miles long, where fallen trees required that we climb over or weave around. It’s no fun to do either, especially since the “weaving” sometimes involved venturing off-trail into the poison ivy. Makes me itch just thinking about it.</p><p>At the west end of Cherry Lake I placed a bench and engraved rock as a memorial for my parents, and my son, Ian. The most recent, pre-derecho photo of the rock and bench was taken on a “scurry” walk around the lake early this Spring. Portions of scurry-partners Jeff Shaw, and the hind-quarters of four-legged scurry member, Titan Edward, can be seen in this photo from that excursion.</p><p><figure><img alt='McFate Memorial Bench at Cherry Lake - Early Spring 2020' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_0121.png'/><figcaption>McFate Memorial Bench at Cherry Lake - Early Spring 2020</figcaption></figure></p><p>On the south side of the lake – visible in the background of the photo above – the trail runs parallel to a road that leads to a brush pile where Tama residents can dump tree limbs, brush and leaves collected from their yard.  There’s been a LOT of that lately! On this occasion a friend of our, Charlie Betz, was hauling a pickup-load of derecho debris to the brush pile and stopped briefly to chat. Charlie suggested that someday soon he would return with his chainsaw to begin clearing deadfall from the trail. We told him to let us know when, and we’d see if we could come help.  Well, that “when” was 7 AM the next day, Saturday, August 22.</p><p>I arrived at the lake at 7 AM on the 22nd and found Charlie already there, preparing to fire up his saw. I brought my little 10' Ryobi cordless electric chainsaw and two fully-charged batteries. Jeff Shaw arrived about 20 minutes later and we proceeded to work our way counter-clockwise around the lake trail startring from the parking area on the east end of the lake.  It was slow going, especially at first since the north side of the lake is, or was, densely wooded with some mature trees.</p><p>After three hours of cutting and tossing debris to the side of the trail, we reached my family’s memorial bench at the west end of the lake.</p><p><figure><img alt='McFate Memorial Bench at Cherry Lake - After the Derecho' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_0324.png'/><figcaption>McFate Memorial Bench at Cherry Lake - After the Derecho</figcaption></figure></p><p>By this time we had waded through way too much PI, been briefly rained on, dulled Charlie’s chainsaw blade, and drained both of the saw batteries I had on hand. I think we were drained too. Time for a break, so at 10 AM we departed for some rest, lunch, fresh batteries, and hopefully a new chain for Charlie’s saw. We reconvened at Noon, as planned, and spent the next two hours clearing the deadfall around the McFate bench, plus a pair of gnarly monsters that had fallen across the trail near the southeast corner of the lake.</p><p>It felt really good to get it all done, and now we can engage in our “scurry” walks around the lake without all the bobbing and weaving required to navigate the obstacle course that was.  Every good volunteer effort should conclude with a photo or two, so we got all cleaned up, NOT, and I shot this one.</p><p><figure><img alt='The Post-Derecho Cherry Lake Trail Cleanup Crew - Me, Charlie, and Jeff' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_0325.png'/><figcaption>The Post-Derecho Cherry Lake Trail Cleanup Crew - Me, Charlie, and Jeff</figcaption></figure></p><p>That’s a warp.

I found that in <a href='https://formcake.com/blog/adding-a-single-page-to-hugo'>How to add a Static Page to Hugo</a> there’s some confusion around the name of the <code>.html</code> file that Joe calls for. In at least one place the file is named <code>/layouts/_default/singlepage.html</code>, but in fact the file should be named <code>/layouts/_default/staticpage.html</code>.</p><p>The other issue I encountered was my fault. My implementation of this “testing” page means that I need to include not just text or markdown content, I also need quite a bit of code, mostly Javascript. So, in my case I duplicated the <code>/layouts/_default/staticpage.html</code> template, calling it <code>/layouts/_default/testpage.html</code>.  My <code>code</code> appears in this new template file. I also changed the content “type” in the frontmatter of <code>/content/testing.md</code> from “staticpage” to “testpage”.

Have a look, and note that the park is currently not reserved for any other events on Hike-n-Seek weekend.</p><p><figure><img alt='Toledo Heights City Park - After the Derecho' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_0327.png'/><figcaption>Toledo Heights City Park - After the Derecho</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='Toledo Heights City Park - After the Derecho' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_0328.png'/><figcaption>Toledo Heights City Park - After the Derecho</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='Toledo Heights City Park - After the Derecho' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_0329.png'/><figcaption>Toledo Heights City Park - After the Derecho</figcaption></figure></p><p>That’s a warp.

Nah, not any more than usual, but during the COVID-19 pandemic I have doubled my efforts to get out and walk in the fresh air whenever possible. I’m thankful for my small “scurry” – that’s the term for a collective of squirrels – who not only take walks with me around Cherry Lake, but all around town.</p><p>About three months ago there was some vandalism at Cherry Lake, and there was a time when folks were leaving lots of trash around the lake.  So our scurry started carrying “<a href='https://ungerconsumer.com/product/36-nifty-nabber/'>Niffty Nabbers</a>” and now we clean up what we can as we walk.  We have even extended the practice beyond the lake, and we generally walk twice a day now, most evenings somewhere in Tama or Toledo away from all the mosquitoes that inhabit Cherry Lake. True to form, we pick up trash as we go.</p><p>I would estimate that both solo and with my scurry, I/we have picked up about 100 pounds of trash so far.</p><p>This past weekend I was thinking… now that we have expaned to more than just Cherry Lake, it would be nice to plot our routes walked somewhere online so that we can keep track of progress, and see where we haven’t been yet. Fortunately, I tend to activate a “workout” recording on my Apple Watch whenever we go out, and I just realized that those routes can be exported from my iPhone as .gpx files.  So, one day soon I hope to create a new section in this blog where I can post records, with maps, of our excursions. Look for it in this blog soon, or at least sooner or later.</p><p>That’s a wrap.

So we have now been more than 10.5 days without power. I’m only able to post this because of a portable generator I bought on August 12 (that was an adventure in itself) and the wireless hotspot that my phone has provided almost 24/7 ever since the storm hit.</p><p>Update: Power was finally restored here at about 6:30 PM, on Thursday, August 20, 2020.  Now I just have 11.5 days of things to catch up on!</p><h2 id='preamble'>Preamble</h2><p>The preamble to this story dates back to Christmas 2019, when my daughter gave me a “Dad’s Love…” daily calendar. There have been a couple of dates I kept because they are so accurate, like the day that says “We child-proofed the house but somehow they still got in.”  😄  Tama County has been in the grips of a moderate-to-severe drought for the past couple of months so the calendar page for August 10 looked like another “keeper”. It says:</p><p><figure><img alt='Monday, August 10, &amp;ldquo;Dad&amp;rsquo;s Love&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Calendar' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Photo-2020-08-18-09-54.jpg'/><figcaption>Monday, August 10, 'Dad's Love...' Calendar</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id='930-am---scurry-walk'>9:30 AM - Scurry Walk</h2><p>This story begins in earnest around 9:30 AM on Monday, August 10, 2020.  My “scurry” and I were just completing a quick walk around Cherry Lake where we had picked up a little trash, as we usually do. We met a couple of neighbors out for a walk and chatted briefly about the weather, and I suggested that the line of storms now in western Iowa looked like they might just hold together. Every weather system thus far in the summer had passed either just to our north, just to the south, or formed just to the east, so the neighbors just scoffed at the notion of us getting any rain. I was so sure it would rain this time that I didn’t hesitate to put a concrete block on the west-half of my hot tub cover to keep it closed in case of wind. I guess I should have used all eight blocks this time?  😕</p><h2 id='1145-am---the-wind'>11:45 AM - The Wind</h2><p>The storms did indeed “hold together”.  Oh boy, did they ever.  A wall of wind hit Tama-Toledo at about 11:45 AM that morning, with literally NO warning from the US Weather Service. I had received alerts from the WeatherBug app on my iPhone, but there was no “official” word of impending doom.  The rain didn’t begin until 5 or 10 minutes later, and I’m not sure any hit the ground because EVERYTHING, tree limbs, mailboxes, small animals, etc., was moving sideways. The power went out moments later. It’s still out as of this writing, a little more than 10 days since.</p><h2 id='1155-am---get-the-cats'>11:55 AM - Get the Cats!</h2><p>After hustling to the basement and realizing the house was not gone, yet, we thought we’d better go back upstairs to get some candles, more flashlights, and our three cats.  Mackenzie and I managed to get two of the cats pretty easily, but the third one was stubborn and had to be “captured”.  While we were doing this I glanced out the window and saw nothing but tree limbs, still sailing past the windows on a nearly horizontal trajectory.</p><p>By the time we captured the last cat I thought to myself, the wind can’t last much longer…it had been blowing for at least 5 minutes straight, and I do mean STRAIGHT. I was very wrong.  Thinking back, I do believe the wind blew at upwards of 100 MPH or more for at least 20 minutes.</p><h2 id='1158-am---morgans-story'>11:58 AM - Morgan’s Story</h2><p>My daughter, Morgan, had been at the STC Middle School in Toledo working on getting her classroom ready for the start of school. She got a call from a friend in Des Moines at about 11:30 AM telling her to watch out for a line of t-storms heading her way. There are no windows in her classroom so when she finally left the Middle School and saw how dark the sky was she got really concerned and promptly ordered the building secretary to open the office and get a handful of students back inside.  They had just dismissed from summer-school and were waiting outside for their parents to pick them up.  Good thing she did that.</p><p>Morgan drove away from the Middle School just minutes before a wall-of-wind roared in, and she called my cell phone at 11:50 AM just as she passed our house, letting me know that she was going straight to her apartment because her landlord wasn’t home and she was worried about her cats. The 5-minute drive to her apartment took about 3 hours?  A couple of minutes later, at 11:55 AM we ran to our basement (after a 2nd mailbox went sailing past our front door) and Morgan called again at 11:58 AM. Her car had been hit by a falling tree limb, about 6' in diameter, near the crest of the hill on State Street in Tama, just south of the Tama Park. Her windshield was shattered, fortunately on the passenger’s side, and she was freaking out. I told her to stay in her car and Christine called 9-1-1 to provide her with some emergency aid.</p><p>The 9-1-1 call had to route through Benton county (30 miles east of us) as the local center was already overwhelmed, and the storm hadn’t hit there yet. A local police officer was dispatched and could get no closer than about 2.5 blocks from Morgan’s car due to downed trees, but made his way to her on-foot. He told her same as me, stay in your car to avoid downed power lines and potentially being hit by flying debris. He also told her to fasten her seatbelt in case the wind flipped the car over. Yikes!  That happened at 12:18 PM, and the wind was still fierce!</p><p>At 12:20 PM my wife realized where Morgan was and called a friend who lives at the location of Morgan’s “tree incident”, and that friend managed to summon her inside once it was safe to make a run for it.</p><h2 id='1230-pm---the-wind-finally-stopped-time-to-rescue-morgan'>12:30 PM - The Wind Finally Stopped, Time to “Rescue” Morgan</h2><p>It was about 12:30 PM when I felt like it was finally safe to go back upstairs and outside. Our mission was to try and get to Morgan as soon as possible.  The power was out so I could not easily raise our double garage door, so I peeked out the front door to see what the situation was. OMG!</p><p>Our house is about 70 years old and it is (was) surrounded by five very large, mature trees… two grand old Oaks flanking the front yard, an American Sycamore directly west of our garage and patio, and two very tall pines on the NW and NE corners of the house, plus a few smaller and younger trees and bushes. Our driveway measures about 15’ x 45’ and it was entirely covered in limbs from one of the oaks and the Sycamore. Some of the limbs down on the driveway measured more than 10' in diameter.  It ultimately took about 14 hours of back-breaking effort just to clear the driveway well enough for us to get both vehicles out of the garage.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the storm I had two other transportation options: the bicycle I had just purchased on Saturday, August 8; or my daughter Mackenzie’s car which was parked at the curb west of our house. I was pretty sure that car, parked partly beneath one of the oaks and the Sycamore, would be badly damaged, but it was not. There were limbs and whole trees, from our neighbor to the west, lying all around it, but the car was unscathed and operable.  It took a little serpentine driving to navigate out of it’s parking spot, but by about 12:45 PM Christine and I were able to get it out and on-the road to try and “rescue” Morgan, roughly 1/2-mile away.</p><p>That 1/2-mile trip featured five impassable streets and a mile or two of back-tracking to find a suitable (barely) route.  The four-lane US Highway 63 proved to be the best route for most of the trip only because it was wide enough that trees on the west side generally didn’t block all four lanes. We arrived in the vicinity of Morgan’s car at 1:02 PM and found that she had already pulled the largest limb off her car, what was left looked like this:</p><p><figure><img alt='Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Damaged Nissan Rogue - A Total Loss' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_2053.jpeg'/><figcaption>Morgan's Damaged Nissan Rogue - A Total Loss</figcaption></figure></p><p>Morgan’s apartment is about 1-mile from the location where we left her car, and she knew that her landlord and family were away in Cedar Rapids for the day, so we headed there to check on that property, and her cats. That trip took about 10 minutes with numerous “detours” but I was able to drive to within a half-block of the house.  Thankfully we found the house intact with no visible, major damage, and the cats were safe, but obviously frightened, still inside Morgan’s apartment. Fortunately, the large old tree outside Morgan’s apartment window was damaged earlier this year in a storm, and had to be taken down entirely just a couple of weeks ago; otherwise it would have certainly damaged the house and her apartment. We called the landlord to report the relatively good news as they tried to begin their journey back home from CR. Then it started to rain again, just a little.</p><h2 id='the-damage'>The Damage</h2><p>This part of the story is perhaps best told in pictures.

It’s the gray thing that looks like a big old boulder on wheels in the right side of the first image below.  It survived, almost unscathed! The only damage was from the door being blown open.  That door hit the west wall of the house so hard that it bent a 1/8' thick steel latch plate back at a 120° angle. Because the door was open, things just inside the door also got a little wet, but they dried out well since then.  The whole camper pitched forward about 3’ in the wind, but the on-board drop-foot was down so it didn’t fall to the ground. Had any large limbs fallen directly on it, we’d have had a total loss of structure and contents.</p><p><figure><img alt='30 Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2030.png'/><figcaption>Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p>Next, the hot tub and grill. The very first thing I did when I got outdoors after the storm was to flip the hot tub cover back down.  I have yet to clean all the leaves and debris out of the water…maybe later today.</p><p>When I receive any alert of a possible storm I always move one of the concrete blocks, seen stacked on the right in the image below, over to the west edge of my hot tub cover in order to keep it from blowing open.  I made that move about 15 minutes before the storm hit, but it didn’t help. In fact, it did more damage, I think.  The cover seems to be OK, but the wind did flip it open, sending the concrete block sailing about 10’ into the side of the house and narrowly missing the bathroom window that you can see. Lucky for us!</p><p>But our gas grill was not so lucky. That concrete block smashed down upon it leaving a big dent in the top, and causing the grill to “list” about 2' to port (the left side when looking from back to front).</p><p><figure><img alt='31 Looking at the Hot Tub and Limbs on the Roof' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2031.png'/><figcaption>Looking at the Hot Tub and Limbs on the Roof</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='45 The Grill' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_3531.png'/><figcaption>Our 1-Year-Old Gas Grill</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='27 Looking South from NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2027.png'/><figcaption>Looking South from NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p>Finally, the limbs on the roof; you can see them clearly in some of these images. There were actually three of them, the largest with a diameter of about 5' at its base.  All three were from the Sycamore tree, which I suppose is lucky.  Sycamore’s have ENORMOUS leaves and while I feared severe damage to the roof, it looks like all three limbs just gently “floated” down to where I found them. I got them sawed up, and down off the roof, including an informal damage inspection plus wasp nest encounter, on Tuesday, August 11.</p><p><figure><img alt='28 Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2028.png'/><figcaption>Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='29 Looking East from the NW Corner of Our Property' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2029.png'/><figcaption>Looking East from the NW Corner of Our Property</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id='the-cleanup'>The Cleanup</h2><h3 id='building-the-worlds-largest--boma'>Building the World’s Largest (?)

None of those things would be available locally until Friday, August 14.</p><p><figure><img alt='16 Our Savior' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2016.png'/><figcaption>Our Savior</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id='my-biggest-remaining-concern---broken-at-the-base'>My Biggest Remaining Concern - Broken at the Base?</h3><p>My biggest remaining worry is the pine tree at the NW corner of the house.  On Thursday, August 13, during clean-up I discovered that the bark on the SE side of the tree is “crushed” as you can see in the image below, and there’s a visible “crack” on the NW side of the tree right at ground-level. Upon closer inspection it looks like the tree is leaning about 5°, naturally right toward our house. 😟</p><p><figure><img alt='1 Broken at the Base?' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%201.png'/><figcaption>Broken at the Base?</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id='houston-we-have-a-problem-or-the-eagle-has-landed'>Houston, We Have a Problem OR The Eagle Has Landed!</h3><p>One block west of our house there’s a bank, and it used to have a large golden-colored eagle atop it’s electronic sign at the intersection of Summit Street and US Highway 63.  When we told folks from out-of-town how to find us we would always use that eagle as a navigational aid, telling them to find the eagle and head one block east to our house.</p><p>Well, our navigational aid got its wings during the storm.  As you can see in the photos below, the eagle “flew” about 200 feet and landed in the bank’s lawn.</p><p><figure><img alt='33 The Eagle Has Landed!' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2033.png'/><figcaption>The Eagle Has Landed!</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='35 The Eagle&amp;rsquo;s Flight Path - Panoramic' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2035.png'/><figcaption>The Eagle's Flight Path - Panoramic</figcaption></figure></p><h3 id='with-no-apparent-structural-damage-we-were-luckier-than-some'>With No Apparent Structural Damage, We Were Luckier Than Some</h3><p><figure><img alt='36 Formerly Thys Chevrolet - 1/2-mile from Home' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Derecho%20-%2036.png'/><figcaption>Formerly Thys Chevrolet - 1/2-mile from Home</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='Just One of Several Collapsed Buildings on My In-Law&amp;rsquo;s Farm' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/IMG_2157.jpeg'/><figcaption>Just One of Several Collapsed Buildings on My In-Law's Farm</figcaption></figure></p><h2 id='oak-hill-cemetery---august-20-2020'>Oak Hill Cemetery - August 20, 2020</h2><p>Since all the Alliant trucks rolled past our house around 10 AM this morning, I thought it was time to visit Ian and my parents at Oak Hill Cemetery. Frustrations at home certainly weren’t getting any better so I felt like getting away to take a deep breath and realign my perspective a little.  Oak Hill usually does that for me.</p><p>Oak Hill Cemetery is well-named…it blankets the hill with Ian and my parents’ graves near the very top, and there are lots of oaks, but even more pines. Well, there used to be anyway.</p><p>This is perhaps another case where photos tell the story better than I.  However, I’m not sure the few photos I took will reflect the scale of the devastation. For starters, the main road up to the cemetery is still blocked, as are the three entrances into the original cemetery. Fortunately, the newest section where there are no mature trees, was relatively clear. So, Morgan and I were able to drive in and park about 100 yards from the hilltop.</p><p>This is a glimpse of what we found there…</p><p><figure><img alt='Oak Hill Cemetery from Near the Hilltop Looking South' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Photo-2020-08-20-19-41.jpeg'/><figcaption>Oak Hill Cemetery from Our Parked Car, Looking South</figcaption></figure></p><p><figure><img alt='180 Degree Panorama' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Photo-2020-08-20-19-43.jpeg'/><figcaption>Oak Hill Cemetery - 180 Degree Panorama</figcaption></figure></p><p>I could not bear to shoot the panorama over the opposing 180° view…it was just too sad. 😢</p><p><figure><img alt='The Big Pine Near the McFate Plots' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Photo-2020-08-20-19-49.jpeg'/><figcaption>The Big Pine Near the McFate Plots</figcaption></figure></p><p>The broken pine, shown above, is, or was, near my parents’ graves, and you can see their shared headstone just to the right in the image above.  My son, Ian, is buried a little to the left of the edge of the image, but you can’t see that grave from this angle because of all the tree debris. <a href='https://coord.info/GC4BG3B'>“Ian’s Cache”, GC4BG3B</a> is somewhere inside or under that tree. I looked for the container for about 15 minutes this morning, but came up empty-handed. 😦</p><p>Fortunately, when the ol’ tree fell it missed Ian’s grave by a few feet. We got lucky and found all four of the clear acrylic cylinders that used to adorn his grave. They are all intact, but need a little TLC before we put them all back out.</p><p>My parents’ headstone is in good shape, but another tree toppled the nearby stone marker for my aunt, Dorothy Paddleford. I’ll see to it that gets fixed soon.</p><p>A few weeks ago my brother-in-law, Dennis, set in-motion a plan to install an engraved stone bench as a memorial for my sister, Marlene McFate Burkheimer. It was to be placed not far from the cemetery road at the very top of the hill, about 50’ from the big pine.  At one time we thought about looking into wrapping a bench around that ol’ pine to provide a nice place, in the shade, to sit and relax. However, providing a concrete base for such a bench would have been very difficult. Maybe if the pine’s stump is removed we can place the bench where the tree was, and maybe one day plant another tree to provide the shady spot we hoped for?</p><p><figure><img alt='Another View to the South from Ian&amp;rsquo;s Grave - The Road is Still Impassable' src='https://images-summittdweller.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2020-Aug-10-Derecho/Photo-2020-08-20-19-51.jpeg'/><figcaption>Another View to the South from Ian's Grave - The Road is Still Impassable</figcaption></figure></p><p>Tomorrow morning I plan to contact the City of Tama and the Oak Hill Cemetery Association to see about volunteering to help with clean-up. I think they are going to want all the help they can get in the coming weeks and months.</p><h2 id='gnight'>G’night</h2><p>It’s late-evening again, but at least now I have some real lights to work by.  Tomorrow I need to start reprogramming all the devices that have been dead for 11.5 days, and begin making up for as many days of missed work. Time for bed. G’night all.</p><p>Until next time… but I hope there’s never another “next time” quite like this one!</p></p></article>\" }]], \"sections\":[[10, 0]] }",

Ouch, I have a lot of workflows that depend on <em>Atom</em>!</p><p>So, today part of my mission is to begin the process of migrating workflows, both work-related and personal/at-home, from <em>Atom</em> to its most logical replacement, <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/'>Visual Studio Code</a> or <em>VS Code</em> as it’s largely known in the development community.  The other part of today’s mission was to update <a href='https://blog.summittdweller.com/'>this blog</a>, something I’ve not done in far too long!</p><p>What better time to begin using <em>VS Code</em> than right now, to edit <a href='http://localhost:1313/posts/2022/06/atom-no-more/posts/2022/06/atom-no-more/'>this blog post</a>?  So, that’s what I did, er, am doing.</p><p>This could be a long story, but I’ll keep it short and just share the links, mostly.  I’ll begin on my personal Mac Mini, where I’m editing now, so I can test the entire process before repeating it on my other Mac workstations.</p><h2 id='install-using-homebrew'>Install Using Homebrew</h2><p>I like to use <code>homebrew</code> whenever possible to manage installations on my Mac. On this Mac Mini I found <a href='https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/visual-studio-code'>this Homebrew Formulae</a> and put it to use…  All done.  Nice!</p><h2 id='adding-a-command-line--terminal-shortcut'>Adding a Command Line / Terminal Shortcut</h2><p>I’ve gotten quite used to launching <em>Atom</em> in my working directory with a simple command of the form <code>atom .</code>.  Can I do the same with <em>VS Code</em>?  Sure!  I used the guidance found in <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-open-visual-studio-code-from-your-terminal/'>How to Open Visual Studio Code From Your Terminal</a> to set that up.  Piece of cake.  I love finding timely, not stale, advice that just works!</p><p>Now I can simply navigate to a project folder on my Mac and type <code>code .</code> to open it all in <em>VS Code</em>.  Sweet!</p><h2 id='replacing-my-atom-packages'>Replacing My Atom Packages</h2><p>There are quite a few, nothing that I’ve written personally, but lots of published packages/extensions borrowed from others.  That’s one of the things I love(d) about <em>Atom</em>. On my Mac Mini, and most other Macs, that list looks something like this:</p><p><figure><img alt='My Installed Atom Packages' src='http://localhost:1313/img/my-atom-packages.png'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I told you there were quite a few.  I’m posting this image of my list just so I have a document as I begin to build the same into <em>VS Code</em>.  Oh, when I added the above image to this post, I did so by dragging my screen-capture from my desktop directly into the <em>VS Code</em> <code>EXPLORER</code> panel (left side of my window), just like I used to do with <em>Atom</em>.  Nice!</p><p>I’ll take my time and start replacing these as-needed.  First up…</p><h3 id='replacing-iso-8601-timestamp'>Replacing <code>ISO 8601 timestamp</code></h3><p>This <em>Atom</em> package allows me to add the current date and time, in ISO 8601 format, to the frontmatter of a blog post like the one you are reading now.  I found and followed <a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring'>this documentation</a> to set it up in <em>VS Code</em>.  In <em>Atom</em> I put my cursor at the point where my timestamp was needed, and went to the <code>Packages</code> menu to insert it.  In <em>VS Code</em> there doesn’t appear to be such a menu, but the documentation says I can use <code>command-shift-P</code> to open the “command pallette”, where I can scroll to or search for the command I want to engage.  Another piece of cake!</p><p>The result of inserting the current timestamp should be reflected in the frontmatter of this blog post.  😀</p><h2 id='more-goodies'>More Goodies</h2><p>This morning I updated this entry after adding a <code>Duplicate file or directory</code> command using the <a href='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmlnc.vscode-duplicate'>Duplicate Action</a> extension from the marketplace.  It works very nicely!</p><p>What’s could be better?  Well, finding a list of <a href='https://dev.to/gsdev/10-vscode-extensions-i-can-t-live-without-1i5c'>10 “must-have” <em>VSCode</em> extensions</a> and working my way through them!</p><h2 id='luna-paint'>Luna Paint</h2><p>I just stumbled across another handy <em>VSCode</em> extension, <code>Luna Paint</code>.

Note that the photos here are in reverse-chronological order with the exception of one “lead” post that lays out our itinerary.  So, read on…</p><p>I drove the 5 of us, plus luggage, in our mini-van to Minneapolis for our departure, and we left home early just in case there were surprises.  Good thing we did!  I drove US 20 to I35 with a stop in Storm Lake for a late lunch.  Not long after that stop we hit the first snag and found I35 closed, in both directions, just south of the Iowa-Minnesota border.  The stop and detour there set us back about a half hour or so…no problem.</p><p>We booked and found off-site parking near the airport in Minneapolis, and got dropped off at the correct terminal for <em>Iceland Air</em>, which will forever be known in this household as <code>Iceland Error</code>.  That’s when things really go interesting.  <code>Iceland Error</code> had changed our flight, and itinerary, without notice (they have no mobile app).  We would be leaving the US about an hour later, good thing, and arriving in Kirkenes about 16 hours ahead of our original schedule! We weren’t even booked on <code>Iceland Error</code> for our departure, instead we were flying <em>Air France</em> to Paris, then to Oslo, and connecting directly to Kirkenes.</p><p>The change meant we had to change terminals, back to the terminal we’d just come from with luggage in tow. Not fun.</p><p>Ok, so <em>Air France</em> was GREAT!  They fed us, we had comfortable seats, they dimmed the lights, had nice entertainment, and provided whatever we needed at no extra charge. For the record, <code>Iceland Error</code> did NONE of that on our return to the U.S.</p><p>But I digress… We got to Paris without a hitch and in good spirits, found our connecting flight to Oslo and made that leg in good shape.  Then on to Kirkenes rather than staying a night in Oslo, and that was OK, except that Kirkenes isn’t a big city, and when we arrived ahead of schedule there was no shuttle waiting for us (the one that did arrive was full), but the good folks there dispatched one especially for us.</p><p>We arrived at our hotel around 11 PM local time, I think.  Of course, it was difficult to tell the time because the sun was still up, and would remain “up” for pretty much the next 4 days!</p><p>The hotel had only one spare room for the night, so Chris and I took that one, and they arranged for Mark, Deb and Doug to taxi about 30 minutes outside of town to a “cabin” near the Russian border.  Lucky for them…they got to set foot, or at least a big toe, in Russia, at about 2 AM, I think.  Silly Americans.  😁</p><p>To be honest, I loved the “midnight sun”, it was great for geocaching, but really put a dent in my already damaged sleep schedule. 😉</p></p></article>\" }]], \"sections\":[[10, 0]] }",

So, there’s a bit of configuration code on the SD card that can be edited to determine if the 5' screen is active, or if the RPI’s output is directed to its HDMI output port.  Well, in the last 2 years I forgot what to edit and what changes to make.</p><p>Fortunately, when I went looking for some info to refresh my memory, I found a great resource… a review posted in 2016 from none other than <a href='https://www.jeffgeerling.com/'>Jeff Geerling</a>, aka <a href='https://github.com/geerlingguy'>geerlingguy</a>.

In case Jeff’s post should ever disappear, here’s the a key piece of info that I needed to jog my memory:</p><div class='original'><h2 id='getting-full-resolution-over-hdmi'>Getting full resolution over HDMI</h2><p>When I first booted the Pi attached to the display, there was a large white area on the right, and only the left portion of the screen was being used by the Pi (it was only using 640x480 of the 800x480 display). To fix this, you have to set a few display options in the configuration file the Raspberry Pi reads during startup to switch certain hardware settings.</p><p>Edit /boot/config.txt (either while booted into Raspbian, or on another computer directly on the microSD card), making sure the following values are set:</p><pre tabindex='0'><code># uncomment if you get no picture on HDMI for a # default 'safe' mode#hdmi_safe=1# uncomment this if your display has a black border of unused # pixels visible and your display can output without overscandisable_overscan=0# uncomment if hdmi display is not detected and composite # is being output#hdmi_force_hotplug=1# uncomment to force a specific HDMI mode (this will force VGA)hdmi_group=2hdmi_mode=1hdmi_mode=87hdmi_cvt=800 480 60 6 0 0 0</code></pre><p>Reboot the Pi either via the UI or by entering sudo reboot in the Terminal. Once rebooted, the Pi should fill up the full 800x480 display.</p><blockquote><p>Note: If the Pi boots up to a funny-looking screen and you can’t see anything, you can either reformat the microSD card, or pull it, edit the /boot/config.txt file from another computer to fix it, and put it back in the Pi.</p></blockquote></div></p></article>\" }]], \"sections\":[[10, 0]] }",

I find that the Apple Photos app does a pretty nice job of cataloging photos and videos into <code>Moments</code>.  Each <code>Moment</code> includes all the images taken in a single day, and sometimes in a particular location, if photos are taken on the same day, but a great distance apart.</p><p>Moment names from my Norway vacation were nicely descriptive, like:</p><ul><li>Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport - Minneapolis, MN, June 11, 2019</li><li>Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport - Mauregard, Île-de-France, June 12, 2019</li><li>Jessheim - Akershus, June 12, 2019</li><li>Kirkenes, Finnmark - Johan Knudtzens gate, June 12, 2019</li><li>Kirkenes, Finnmark - Dr. Wessels gate, June 13, 2019</li><li>Kirkenes, Finnmark - Johan Knudtzens gate, June 14, 2019</li><li>Skarsvåg - Finnmark, June 14, 2019</li><li>Arnøyhamn - Norway, June 15, 2019</li></ul><h2 id='exporting-the-photos'>Exporting the Photos</h2><p>I found <a href='https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/export-photos-videos-and-slideshows-pht6e157c5f/mac'>this resource</a> on the web and followed it for the export portion of my process.</p><p>So, I opened <code>Photos</code> on my Mac Mini, selected the <code>Moments</code> view/tab, culled some of the duplicates out, then selected all 359 remaining images using my mouse.  With the images highlighted I selected menu options: <code>File</code>, <code>Export</code>, and <code>Export 359 Photos...</code>. I subsequently filled in the following dialog like so:</p><p><figure><img alt='Photos Export Dialog' src='https://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png'/><figcaption></figcaption></figure></p><p>I choose a ‘Photo Kind’, or format, equal to <code>PNG</code> and a ‘Size’ equal to <code>Medium</code>, since most of the images are huge and would load very slowly in my blog if left at their original size.  I elected to save the exported PNG images into a new folder on my <code>~/Desktop</code> named <code>Norway-Medium-PNG-Export</code>.</p><h2 id='upload-to-digital-ocean-spaces'>Upload to Digital Ocean “Spaces”</h2><p>A few days ago I registered with <em>Digital Ocean</em> <a href='https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces?i=d7d6c7'>“Spaces”</a>, and created my first “bucket” named <code>images-summittdweller</code>. <em>Spaces</em> provides me with up to 280 GB of REST-accessible object storage for a small monthly fee.  To host my photos there I simply created a “folder” named <a href='https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/images-summittdweller?i=d7d6c7&amp;path=Norway-Photos-2019%2F'>Norway-Photos-2019</a> and did a drag-n-drop of each <code>~/Desktop/Norway-Medium-PNG-Export/</code> individual* folder directly into my browser window.  *Note that the drag-n-drop interface was unable to swallow the entire <code>Norway-Medium-PNG-Export</code> folder all at once. 😞</p><p>All of my uploads to the <code>images-summittdweller</code> bucket were declared as <code>Public</code> rather than <code>Private</code>, that way they can be accessed using simple URLs without authentication.</p><h2 id='additional-images'>Additional Images</h2><p>In addition to the aforementioned photos, I also parked a copy of the <code>PhotosExportDialog.png</code> screen capture there in the root folder.  It’s accessible as <a href='https://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png'>https://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png</a> and that’s what I used above to embed the image you see in this document.</p><p>In the future, more images, perhaps some taken by Deb, Doug, or Mark McCune, can be added to this photo blog in a similar manner.</p><h2 id='object-structure-and-urls'>Object Structure and URLs</h2><p>A sampling of the bucket/object/filenames and URLs from <code>images-summittdweller</code> are tabulated below.
